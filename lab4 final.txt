/* Assignment
Plan and code a program utilizing one or more repetition structures to solve the following problem :
After caffeine is absorbed into the body, 13 % is eliminated from the body each hour.Assume a person drinks
an 8 - oz cup of brewed coffee containing 130 mg of caffeine, and that the caffeine is absorbed immediately
into the body.

Write a program to calculate the following values :
(a)The number of hours required until 65 mg(one - half the original amount) remain in the body.
(b)The amount of caffeine in the body X hours after the person drinks the coffee.

Input
Person’s name and how many hours they want to see the output for.

Output
For(a) above, just the number of hours required until 65 mg remain in the body.
For(b) above, a listing of caffeine remaining after each hour until the user’s limit is reached.
